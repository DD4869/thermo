- This python file is for a thermometer by using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ and DHT22(AM2302) integrated with LINE application.

- To implement the code, you need to get your LINE Notify Token in advance and connect DHT22 to Raspberry Pi in advance.
Raspberry Pi GPIO Pins can be referred here (or you can use <pinout> commnad).

- Also, for better implementation, it is better to set cron for the python file as you can receive notifications from time to time.
