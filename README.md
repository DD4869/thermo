- This python file is for a thermometer by using Raspberry Pi 3b+ and DHT22(AM2302) integrated with LINE application.

- To implement the code, you need to get your LINE Notify Token in advance and connect DHT22 to Raspberry Pi in advance.

- Also, for better implementation, it is better to set cron for the python file as you can receive notifications from time to time.
